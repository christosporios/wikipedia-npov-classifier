 In 2022, Human Rights Watch issued a report on the situation in the Gaza Strip, which it called an ""open-air prison"" due to the [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockade]] and held Israel responsible as the occupying power, and to a lesser degree Egypt, which has restricted movement of Palestinians through its border.&lt;ref name=""HRW111""/> The report highlighted how this blockade has led to humanitarian crises, namely shortages of essential supplies, limited access to healthcare, and high levels of poverty and unemployment among the Palestinian population in Gaza.&lt;ref name=""HRW111""/> It claimed that Israel has formed a formal policy of separation between Gaza and the West Bank, despite both forming parts of the [[Palestinian territories]].&lt;ref name=""HRW111""/> The Israeli blockade on Gaza has restricted the freedom of movement of Gaza Palestinians to both the West Bank and the outside world; in particular, Palestinian professionals were most impacted by these restrictions, as applying for travel permit takes several weeks.&lt;ref name=""HRW111""/>

Since 1967, Israel has allowed and even encouraged its citizens to live in the new settlements established in the territories, motivated by religious and national sentiments attached to the history of the Jewish nation in the land of Israel. This policy has also been justified in terms of security interests, taking into consideration the dangerous geographic circumstances of Israel before 1967 (where Israeli areas on the Mediterranean coast were potentially threatened by Jordanian control of the West Bank ridge). The international community, for its part, has viewed this policy as patently illegal, based on the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention that prohibit moving populations to or from territories under occupation.|issue=3|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

 The combat option is [[Israel Border Police]] (''Magav'' – the exact translation from Hebrew means ""border guard"") service, part of the [[Israel Police]]. Some soldiers complete their IDF combat training and later undergo additional [[counter terror]] and Border Police training. These are assigned to Border Police units. The Border Police units fight side by side with the regular IDF combat units though to a lower capacity. They are also responsible for security in heavy urban areas such as [[Jerusalem]] and security and crime fighting in rural areas.

[[Theodor Meron]] at the time the Israeli government's authority on the topic of international law and legal counsel to the [[Israeli Foreign Ministry]], was asked to provide a memorandum regarding the status in international law of proposed settlement of the territories, which he subsequently addressed to the Foreign Minister [[Abba Eban]] on 14 September 1967. He concluded that short-term military settlements would be permissible.{{sfn|Macintyre|2006}} but that ""civilian settlement in the [[administered territories]] contravenes the explicit provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention,"" adding that the prohibition on any such [[population transfer]] was categorical, and that ""civilian settlement in the administered territories contravenes the explicit provisions of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]].""{{sfn|Gorenberg|2007|pp=99–100}} It follows from the presence on files of these notes, [[Gershom Gorenberg]] argues, that the Prime Minister at the time, [[Levi Eshkol]], knew that Israeli settlements in the territories Israel had just occupied would violate international laws and that by that time Eshkol had been actively engaged in exploring the possibility of settling the newly conquered region.{{sfn|Gorenberg|2007|p=100}}  Meron’s  unequivocal legal opinion was marked  top secret and  not made public.{{sfn|Segev |2016|p=576}}

 In 1978 and 1979 the Israeli Supreme court, prompted by the new government policies, ruled on two important cases that set out the requirements for Israeli settlement legality under international law. In Ayauub ''et al.'' vs. Minister of Defence (the Beit-El Toubas case), the Court determined that the Hague Conventions but not the Geneva Conventions could be applied by Israeli courts on land and settlement issues in the occupied territories. The following year the Court ruled on Dwikat ''et al.'' vs. the Government of Israel (the [[Elon Moreh]] case), outlining the Hague Conventions' limitations on Israeli land acquisition and settlements. Settlements, whether on private or public land, could not be considered permanent, nor could the land be permanently confiscated, only temporarily requisitioned. Settlements on private land were legal only if determined to be a military necessity; the original owner retained title to the land and must be paid rental fees for its use. Public lands' ""possession cannot be alienated, nor its basic character transformed"".&lt;ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4326305 ""Israel and the West Bank after Elon Moreh: The Politics of De Facto Annexation""] Ian Lustick&lt;/ref>

 In subsequent cases, such as the Ja'amait Ascan case regarding a project to link West Bank towns to Jerusalem with a four-way highway network, the Court  ruled that Article 43 of the Hague IV Convention is a mandatory planning consideration for approval of building projects in the West Bank. The convention established that an occupier may not take into consideration ""the national, economic or social interests of his own country, unless they have implications for his security interests or the interests of the local population.""

 The '''Israeli-occupied territories''' are the territories [[Military occupation|occupied]] by [[Israel]] during the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967. Originally, those territories included the Syrian [[Golan Heights]], the Egyptian [[Sinai Peninsula]] and [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|Egyptian-occupied Gaza Strip]] and [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordanian-annexed West Bank]]. The first use of the term 'territories occupied' was in [[United Nations Security Council]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|Resolution 242]] following the Six-Day War in 1967, which called for ""the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East"" to be achieved by ""the application of both the following principles: ... Withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict ... Termination of all claims or states of belligerency"" and respect for the right of every state in the area to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.  In addition to the territories occupied following the Six-Day War, Israel also occupied portions of [[Southern Lebanon]] following the [[1982 Lebanon War]], and maintained a military and administrative presence there until withdrawing in 2000.

-To support the Bar Lev Line, Israel built an well planned and elaborate system of roads. Three main roads ran north-south.

The second was the Artillery Road, around {{convert|10|-|12|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} from the canal.

 The defense of the Sinai depended upon two plans, [[Dovecote]] (שׁוֹבָךְ יוֹנִים/Shovakh Yonim) and Rock (סֶלַע/Sela). In both plans, the Israeli General Staff expected the Bar-Lev Line to serve as a ""stop line"" or ''kav atzira''—a defensive line that had to be held at all cost. As noted by an Israeli colonel shortly after the War of Attrition, ""The line was created to provide military answers to two basic needs: first, to prevent the possibility of a major Egyptian assault on Sinai with the consequent creation of a bridgehead which could lead to all-out war; and, second, to reduce as much as possible the casualties among the defending troops.""&lt;ref name=""gawrych16-18"" />

 In February 2005, the Israeli government voted to implement a [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|unilateral disengagement plan]] from the Gaza Strip.  The plan began to be implemented on 15 August 2005, and was completed on 12 September 2005. Under the plan, all Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip (and four in the West Bank) and the joint Israeli-Palestinian Erez Industrial Zone were dismantled with the removal of all 9,000 Israeli settlers (most of them in the [[Gush Katif]] settlement area in the Strip's southwest) and military bases. Some settlers resisted the order, and were forcibly removed by the IDF.  On 12 September 2005 the Israeli cabinet formally declared an end to Israeli military occupation of the Gaza Strip.  To avoid allegations that it was still in occupation of any part of the Gaza Strip, Israel also withdrew from the [[Philadelphi Route]], which is a narrow strip adjacent to the [[Egypt–Gaza border|Strip's border with Egypt]], after Egypt's agreement to secure its side of the border.  Under the Oslo Accords the Philadelphi Route was to remain under Israeli control to prevent the smuggling of materials (such as ammunition) and people across the border with Egypt.  With Egypt agreeing to patrol its side of the border, it was hoped that the objective would be achieved.  However, Israel maintained its control over the crossings in and out of Gaza.  The Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza was monitored by the Israeli army through special surveillance cameras.  Official documents such as passports, I.D. cards, export and import papers, and many others had to be approved by the Israeli army.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

 In the [[2006 Palestinian legislative election|Palestinian legislative elections]] on 25 January 2006, [[Hamas]] emerged victorious and nominated [[Ismail Haniyeh]] as the Authority's Prime Minister. However, the national unity Palestinian government effectively collapsed, when a violent conflict between Hamas and Fatah erupted, mainly in the Gaza Strip. After the [[Battle for Gaza (2007)|Gaza Strip was taken over by Hamas]] on 14 June 2007, the Authority's Chairman [[Mahmoud Abbas]] dismissed the [[Palestinian March 2007 National Unity Government|Hamas-led unity government]] and appointed [[Salam Fayyad]] as [[Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Prime Minister]], dismissing Haniyeh. The move wasn't recognized by Hamas, thus resulting in two separate administrations – the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and a rival [[Governance of the Gaza Strip|Hamas government]] in the Gaza Strip. The [[Fatah–Hamas reconciliation process|reconciliation process]] to unite the Palestinian governments achieved some progress over the years, but had failed to produce a re-unification.

Alistair Crooke, a former Middle East adviser to the EU foreign policy chief [[Javier Solana]], similarly observed, ""Dahlan refused to deal with (the independent interior minister appointed to the unity government), and put his troops on the streets in defiance of the interior minister. Hamas felt that they had little option but to take control of security away from forces which were in fact creating insecurity."" Hence, Hamas was not attempting a coup against the government or the Fatah organization as a whole but also against Dahlan's U.S.-funded militia (and individual Fatah loyalists it blamed for the murder of Hamas members).'&lt;/ref> subsequently warring with Israel.

However the Plan also provided that Israel will guard and monitor the external land perimeter of the Gaza Strip, will continue to maintain exclusive authority in Gaza air space, and will continue to exercise security activity in the sea off the coast of the Gaza Strip as well as maintaining an Israeli military presence on the Egyptian-Gaza border. and reserving the right to reenter Gaza at will. &lt;br />Israel continues to control six of Gaza's seven land crossings, its maritime borders and airspace and the movement of goods and persons in and out of the territory.

Israel has declared a no-go buffer zone that stretches deep into Gaza: if Gazans enter this zone they are shot on sight. Gaza is also dependent on Israel for water, electricity, telecommunications and other utilities, currency, issuing IDs, and permits to enter and leave the territory.

The blockade became indefinite after the 2007 Hamas takeover and was supported by Egypt through restrictions on its land border with Gaza. Despite the Israeli disengagement, the [[United Nations]], the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], and many human-rights organizations continue to consider Gaza to be held under Israeli military occupation, due to what they consider Israel's effective military control over the territory; Israel disputes that it occupies the territory.&lt;ref>{{cite web | last=Dagres | first=Holly | title=Israel claims it is no longer occupying the Gaza Strip.

Pursuant to the Disengagement Plan, Israel dismantled all military institutions and settlements in Gaza and there is no longer a permanent Israeli military or civilian presence in the territory. However the Plan also provided that Israel will guard and monitor the external land perimeter of the Gaza Strip, will continue to maintain exclusive authority in Gaza air space, and will continue to exercise security activity in the sea off the coast of the Gaza Strip as well as maintaining an Israeli military presence on the Egyptian-Gaza border. and reserving the right to reenter Gaza at will. &lt;br />Israel continues to control six of Gaza's seven land crossings, its maritime borders and airspace and the movement of goods and persons in and out of the territory. Egypt controls one of Gaza's land crossings. Troops from the Israeli Defence Force regularly enter pans of the territory and/or deploy missile attacks, drones and sonic bombs into Gaza. Israel has declared a no-go buffer zone that stretches deep into Gaza: if Gazans enter this zone they are shot on sight. Gaza is also dependent on Israel for water, electricity, telecommunications and other utilities, currency, issuing IDs, and permits to enter and leave the territory. Israel also has sole control of the Palestinian Population Registry through which the Israeli Army regulates who is classified as a Palestinian and who is a Gazan or West Banker. Since 2000 aside from a limited number of exceptions Israel has refused to add people to the Palestinian Population Registry.&lt;br />It is this direct external control over Gaza and indirect control over life within Gaza that has led the United Nations, the UN General Assembly, the UN Fact Finding Mission to Gaza, International human rights organisations, US Government websites, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and a significant number of legal commentators, to reject the argument that Gaza is no longer occupied. |editor=M.N.

 The Palestinian Authority was formed in 1994, pursuant to the Oslo Accords between the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) and the government of [[Israel]], as a five-year [[Provisional government|interim body]]. Further negotiations were then meant to take place between the two parties regarding its final status.  According to the Oslo Accords, the Palestinian Authority was designated to have exclusive control over both security-related and civilian issues in Palestinian urban areas (referred to as ""[[West Bank Areas in the Oslo II Accord#Area A|Area A]]"") and only civilian control over Palestinian rural areas (""[[West Bank Areas in the Oslo II Accord#Area B|Area B]]""). The remainder of the territories, including [[Israeli settlements]], the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] region and bypass roads between [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] communities, were to remain under Israeli control (""[[Area C (West Bank)|Area C]]""). [[East Jerusalem]] was excluded from the Accords. Negotiations with several Israeli governments had resulted in the Authority gaining further control of some areas, but control was then lost in some areas when the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) retook several strategic positions during the [[Second Intifada|Second (""Al-Aqsa"") Intifada]].

 In the [[2006 Palestinian legislative election|Palestinian legislative elections]] on 25 January 2006, [[Hamas]] emerged victorious and nominated [[Ismail Haniyeh]] as the Authority's Prime Minister. However, the national unity Palestinian government effectively collapsed, when a violent conflict between Hamas and Fatah erupted, mainly in the Gaza Strip. After the [[Battle for Gaza (2007)|Gaza Strip was taken over by Hamas]] on 14 June 2007, the Authority's Chairman [[Mahmoud Abbas]] dismissed the [[Palestinian March 2007 National Unity Government|Hamas-led unity government]] and appointed [[Salam Fayyad]] as [[Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Prime Minister]], dismissing Haniyeh.

In 2005, after the Second Intifada, Israel withdrew [[:wiktionary:Unilateral|unilaterally]] from its settlements in the Gaza Strip, thereby expanding Palestinian Authority control to the entire strip.{{clarify|date=November 2013}}
 
 In the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|Palestinian legislative elections]] on 25 January 2006, [[Hamas]] emerged victorious and nominated [[Ismail Haniyeh]] as the Authority's Prime Minister. However, the national unity Palestinian government effectively collapsed, when a violent conflict between Hamas and Fatah erupted, mainly in the Gaza Strip. After the [[Battle for Gaza (2007)|Gaza Strip was taken over by Hamas]] on 14 June 2007, the Authority's Chairman [[Mahmoud Abbas]] dismissed the [[Palestinian March 2007 National Unity Government|Hamas-led unity government]] and appointed [[Salam Fayyad]] as [[Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Prime Minister]], dismissing Haniyeh. The move wasn't recognized by Hamas, thus resulting in two separate administrations - the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and a rival [[Governance of the Gaza Strip|Hamas government]] in the Gaza Strip. The [[Fatah–Hamas reconciliation process|reconciliation process]] to unite the Palestinian governments achieved some progress over the years, but had failed to produce a re-unification.

 The '''Quebec - New England Transmission''' is a long-distance [[HVDC]] line between [[Radisson]], [[Quebec]] in [[Canada]] and Sandy Pond in [[Ayer, Massachusetts|Ayer]], [[Massachusetts]]. In contrast to most other HVDC facilities, it is equipped  with multiple static inverter stations.
 
-Originally, the Quebec - New England Transmission consisted of the 172 [[kilometer]] section between [[Des Cantons]] in [[Quebec]], Canada and [[Comerford, New Hampshire|Comerford]], [[New Hampshire]] which, because of the asynchronous operation of the American and Canadian power grid, had to be implemented as HVDC. This line, which is in the whole length implemented as overhead line, went into service in [[1986]]. It could transfer a maximum power of 690 [[megawatt]]s. The operating voltage was +/-450 [[kV]].

-Already, at the time of inauguration, the line was planned to extend the line beyond the two terminals in Des Cantons and Comerford to the hydro-electric power plants at [[James Bay]] and to the consumption emphasis in the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], Massachusetts area. For this reason the line was extended by 1100 kilometers to the north toward the [[static inverter plant]] at Radisson and to the south to the static inverter plant at Sandy Pond in Massachusetts. The transmission rate was increased by extending the existing static inverter stations to 2000 megawatts. The value of the transmission voltage remained unchanged at +/-450kV. For the connection of the [[Montreal]] area, a further static inverter station at [[Nicolet]] with a transmission capacity of 2000 megawatts went in service in [[1992]].

Additional immigrants arrived from Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey, Iran, India, and elsewhere. Within three years, the Jewish population of Israel doubled. The ethnic composition of the population shifted as well, as immigrants from Muslim counties and their offspring now comprised one third of the Jewish population—an unprecedented phenomenon in global immigration history. From 1952–60, Israel regulated and restricted immigration from Muslim countries with a selective immigration policy based on economic criteria, and sent these immigrants, most of whom were North African, to peripheral Israeli settlements. The selective immigration policy ended in 1961 when, following an agreement between Israel and Morocco, about 100,000 Jews immigrated to the State. From 1952–68 about 600,000 Jews arrived in Israel, three quarters of whom were from Arab countries and the remaining immigrants were largely from Eastern Europe.

-The '''Israeli-occupied territories'''  is a political concept, referring to the territories [[Military occupation|occupied]] by [[Israel]] during the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967. Originally, those territories included the Syrian [[Golan Heights]], the Egyptian [[Sinai Peninsula]] and [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|Egyptian-occupied Gaza Strip]] and [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordanian-annexed West Bank]]. The first use of the term 'territories occupied' was in [[United Nations Security Council]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|Resolution 242]] following the Six-Day War in 1967, which called for ""the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East"" to be achieved by ""the application of both the following principles: ... Withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict ... Termination of all claims or states of belligerency"" and respect for the right of every state in the area to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.

 From 1967 to 1982, the four areas were governed under the [[Israeli Military Governorate]] (also named as ''Occupied Arab territories''{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} by the UN). The IMG was dissolved in 1982, after the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]]. In the process, Israel handed the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, the Golan Heights was incorporated into the [[Northern District (Israel)|Northern District]] by the [[Golan Heights Law]], and West Bank continued to be administrated via the [[Israeli Civil Administration]]. Despite dissolving the military government, in line with Egyptian demands, the term ''Israeli-occupied territories'' remains in use, referring to the [[West Bank]] including [[East Jerusalem]], the [[Gaza Strip]] and Western [[Golan Heights]]. Between 1998 and 2012, the term [[Palestinian territories, Occupied]] was used to refer to territories controlled by the [[Palestinian Authority]] in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

 In 2015, Rav Aluf [[Gadi Eizenkot]] ordered the unit's closure in order to assimilate the Druze soldiers no differently than Jewish soldiers, as part of an ongoing reorganization of the army. Several Druze officers reached ranks as high as Major General, and many received commendations for distinguished service. In proportion to their numbers, the Druze people achieve much higher—documented—levels in the Israeli army than other soldiers. Nevertheless, some Druze still charge that discrimination continues, such as exclusion from the [[Israel Air Force|Air Force]], although the official low security classification for Druze has been abolished for some time. The first Druze aircraft navigator completed his training course in 2005. Like all air force pilots, his identity is not disclosed. During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], many Druze who had initially sided with the Arabs deserted their ranks to either return to their villages or side with Israel in various capacities.&lt;ref name=""Gelber"">{{cite news |title= Druze and Jews in the war of 1948.

+While speaking to ''[[CNN]]'' reporters in February 2024, some Palestinians have alleged that the humanitarian aid that is allowed into Gaza is often poorly regulated and can be concentrated in areas, which has helped create a flourishing black market. Humanitarian parcels received by Palestinians have reportedly already been opened with contents removed. Israeli airstrikes around certain areas have also caused prices to spike with a 25-kilogram bag of flour jumping from $20 in Kahn Younis to $34 after intensified airstrikes.&lt;ref>{{Cite web |last=Rahimi |first=Sana Noor Haq, Rosa |date=2024-01-30 |title=‘We are dying slowly.’ Children go to bed hungry and parents scavenge for food as famine looms in Gaza |url=https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/30/middleeast/famine-looms-in-gaza-israel-war-intl/index.html |access-date=2024-02-09 |website=CNN |language=en}}&lt;/ref>

+'''Donna Hylton''' (born October 29, 1964 in Jamaica, now a naturalized American citizen) is a women's rights activist and criminal justice reform advocate. She speaks publicly about the issues facing incarcerated and formerly incarcerated women and girls 
+  
+Hylton, a survivor of childhood gender-based violence and sexual abuse, is currently focusing her activism on highlighting the pervasiveness of gender-based violence and sexual abuse in the lived experience of women and girls as a direct link to the choices, circumstances and psychological factors that result in their incarceration. It is estimated that among incarcerated women 90% have experienced violence throughout their lifetimes; 80% experienced serious physical and/or sexual abuse as children and 75% experienced intimate partner violence.&lt;ref>2016 U.S. Correctional Association&lt;/ref> Her goal is to be a driving force in creating the public awareness of these narratives and the opportunities for women to tell their full stories in their own words. Most recently, Hylton was a featured speaker at the [[2017 Women's March|Women's March on Washington]].&lt;ref>{{cite web|title=Speakers|url=https://www.womensmarch.com/speakers/|accessdate=23 January 2017}} 
 
+In the past she has also advocated for the 'compassionated release' of aging prisoners based on humanitarian principles.&lt;/ref>&lt;ref name=""Quartz"">{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/634453/keeping-elderly-inmates-behind-bars-makes-a-mockery-of-our-so-called-justice-system/|title=Keeping rehabilitated inmates behind bars makes a mockery of America’s so-called justice system|first=Keri|last=Blakinger|date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref> 
 
-In 1985, at the age of 19, Hylton was convicted and sentenced to 25 years to life, ultimately serving 27 years for the murder of the 62-year-old real-estate broker Thomas Vigliarole. She drugged, kidnapped, beat, raped, burned, sodomized with a 3 foot steel pole, clamped his testicles with a pair of pliers before ultimately shoving him in a trunk to suffocate to death. She is a sick piece of garbage and was a prominent speaker at the women's march on Washington. Needless to say they didnt mention her tourturing and murder of a gay, white man during her speech about racial and gender inequality against women of color. How nice! Hopefully she will die a slow and painful death one day here soon. Until then she continues to walk amongst us as another lefty liberal hypocrite social justice warrior. Awesome!

 In the late 19th century European and Middle Eastern Jewish communities began to increasingly immigrate to Palestine and purchase land from the local Ottoman landlords. The population of the late 19th century in Palestine reached 600,000 – mostly Muslim Arabs, but also significant minorities of Jews, Christians, Druze and some [[Samaritans]] and [[Baháʼí Faith|Baháʼís]]. At that time, Jerusalem did not extend beyond the walled area and had a population of only a few tens of thousands. Collective farms, known as [[kibbutz]]im, were established, as was the first entirely Jewish city in modern times, [[Tel Aviv]].

 The Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon took place after [[Israel]] invaded [[Lebanon]] during the [[1982 Lebanon War]] and subsequently retained its forces to support the Christian [[South Lebanon Army]] militia in Southern Lebanon. In 1982, the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] (IDF) and allied [[Free Lebanon Army]] Christian militias seized large sections of Lebanon, including the capital of [[Beirut]], amid the hostilities of the wider [[Lebanese Civil War]]. Later, Israel withdrew from parts of the occupied area between 1983 and 1985, but remained in partial control of the border region known as the ''South Lebanon Security Belt'', initially in coordination with the self-proclaimed [[Free Lebanon State]], which executed a limited authority over portions of southern [[Lebanon]] until 1984, and later with the [[South Lebanon security belt administration]] and its [[South Lebanon Army]] (transformed from Free Lebanon Army), until the year 2000. Israel's stated purpose for the Security Belt was to create a space separating its northern border towns from terrorists residing in Lebanon.

 Both regimes - the Ramallah and Gaza government regard themselves as the sole legitimate government of the Palestinian National Authority. Egyptian-mediated negotiations toward reconciliation between the Fatah and the Hamas government produced a preliminary agreement, planned to be implemented by May 2012 in joint elections. To date, the Hamas government is only economically bonded with the Ramallah-based Palestinian National Authority, performing the governing over the Gaza Strip independently.

-'''Hamas genocide against Israelis''' refers to the accusation by some experts in the fields of [[international law]] and [[genocide studies]] that [[Hamas]], a [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] [[Islamism|Islamist]] group widely designated [[List of designated terrorist groups|a terrorist organization]], has committed [[genocide]] against [[Israelis]] in [[2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel|its surprise attack on Israel]] on 7 October 2023. In the course of the assault, Hamas militants raided communities in southern Israel, killing, torturing, and mutilating men, women, and children. The death toll reached 1,200, the majority of them [[Civilian casualty|civilians]]. 240 men, women and children of all ages were kidnapped and taken to the [[Gaza Strip]]. Some legal and genocide experts condemned the attack as a serious violation of international law, asserting that Hamas carried out these acts with the intent to destroy the Israeli national group. Commentators point to Hamas' [[1988 Hamas charter|founding charter]], which [[Calls for the destruction of Israel|advocated for the destruction of Israel]], features [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] language, and, according to some researchers, also called for the genocide of Jews, suggesting that the attacks of October 7 were an attempt to fulfill this agenda.

 As of December 6, the sole water desalination facility in northern Gaza was inoperative, while the pipeline that delivers water from Israel to the north remained shut, thereby heightening the likelihood of dehydration and waterborne illnesses due to the consumption of unsafe water sources. The impact on hospitals has been severe, as only one out of the 24 hospitals in northern Gaza is operational and capable of accepting new patients, albeit with limited services, as of December 14.&lt;ref name=""HRW-2023-12-18""/>

 In his address to the UN Security Council on 31 January 2024, Martin Griffiths, the UN under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordination, provided a comprehensive overview of the challenges currently confronting numerous individuals in Gaza. According to our latest estimates, approximately 75 percent of the entire population has been displaced. The living conditions they endure are deplorable and deteriorating with each passing day. The makeshift tent camps, established by refugees and displaced people, are being inundated by heavy rains, compelling children, parents, and the elderly to seek shelter in the mud. The issue of food insecurity continues to escalate, while access to clean water remains almost entirely unattainable. Given the limited availability of public health support, preventable diseases are rampant and will persistently propagate.&lt;ref>[https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/humanitarian-situation-in-gaza/ Humanitarian impact of the conflict] Retrieved 13 February 2024&lt;/ref>

 Israel is located in the [[Southern Levant]], a region known historically as [[Canaan]], the [[Land of Israel]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and the [[Holy Land]]. In antiquity, it was home to several [[Israelites|Israelite]] and [[Jews|Jewish]] kingdoms, including [[Israel and Judah]] and [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean Judea]]. Over the ages, the region was ruled by imperial powers such as the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]], [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonians]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], [[Hellenistic period|Greeks]], and [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. During Roman rule, Jews became a minority in Palestine. The region later came under [[Byzantine]] and [[Arab conquest of the Levant|Arab rule]]. In the medieval period, it was part of the [[Islamic caliphates]], the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The late 19th century saw the rise of [[Zionism]], a movement advocating for the establishment of a [[Homeland for the Jewish people|Jewish homeland]], during which the [[Jewish land purchase in Palestine|Jewish people began purchasing land in Palestine]]. Under the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] by the [[League of Nations]] after World War I, [[Aliyah|Jewish immigration]] to the region increased considerably, leading to [[Intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine|tensions between Jews and the Arab majority population]]. The UN-approved [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|1947 partition plan]] triggered [[1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine|a civil war]] between these two peoples. The British terminated the Mandate on 14 May 1948, and Israel [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] on the same day.

 [[File:Israel and Palestine Peace.svg|thumb|left|A [[peace movement]] poster: [[Flag of Israel|Israeli]] and [[Palestinian flag]]s and the word ''peace'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].]]
 
-In 1993, Israeli officials led by [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and Palestinian leaders from the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] led by [[Yasser Arafat]] strove to find a peaceful solution through what became known as the Oslo peace process. A crucial milestone in this process was Arafat's letter of recognition of Israel's right to exist. In 1993, the Oslo Accords were finalized as a framework for future Israeli–Palestinian relations.

+In 1993, Israeli officials led by [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and Palestinian leaders from the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] led by [[Yasser Arafat]] strove to find a peaceful solution through what became known as the Oslo peace process. A crucial milestone in this process was Arafat's letter of recognition of Israel's right to exist. In 1993, the Oslo Accords were finalized as a framework for future Israeli–Palestinian relations. The crux of the Oslo agreement was that Israel would gradually cede control of the Palestinian territories over to the Palestinians in exchange for peace. The Oslo process was delicate and progressed in fits and starts. The process took a turning point at the [[assassination of Yitzhak Rabin]] in November 1995 and finally unraveled when Arafat and [[Ehud Barak]] failed to reach agreement at Camp David in July 2000. [[Robert Malley]], special assistant to US President [[Bill Clinton]] for Arab–Israeli Affairs, has confirmed that while Barak made no formal written offer to Arafat, the US did present concepts for peace which were considered by the Israeli side yet left unanswered by Arafat: ""the Palestinians' principal failing is that from the beginning of the Camp David summit onward they were unable either to say yes to the American ideas or to present a cogent and specific counterproposal of their own"".&lt;ref>{{Cite news|last1=Agha|first1=Hussein|last2=Malley|first2=Robert|title=Camp David: The Tragedy of Errors|journal=New York Review of Books|language=en|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2001/08/09/camp-david-the-tragedy-of-errors/|access-date=2022-03-05|issn=0028-7504|archive-date=6 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180906052533/https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2001/08/09/camp-david-the-tragedy-of-errors/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref> Consequently, there are different accounts of the proposals considered.&lt;ref>{{Cite web|date=2001-09-01|title=Propositions israéliennes, de Camp David (2000) à Taba (2001)|url=https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/cartes/taba2001|access-date=2022-03-05|website=Le Monde diplomatique|language=fr|archive-date=5 March 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220305205555/https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/cartes/taba2001|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>{{Cite news|last1=Agha|first1=Hussein|last2=Malley|first2=Robert|title=Camp David and After: An Exchange (2.

Wandering into [[Maryon Park]], he takes photos of two lovers. The woman ([[Vanessa Redgrave]]) is furious at being photographed, pursues Thomas, demands his film and ultimately tries to snatch his camera.  He refuses and photographs her as she runs off.
 
 Thomas then meets his agent Ron ([[Peter Bowles]]) for lunch and notices a man following him and looking into his car. Back at his studio, the woman from the park arrives asking desperately for the film.  They have a conversation and flirt, but he deliberately hands her a different film roll. She in turn writes down a false telephone number and gives it to him.  He curiously makes many enlargements of the black and white film of the two lovers.  They reveal the woman worriedly looking at a third person lurking in the trees with a pistol.  Thomas excitedly calls Ron, claiming his impromptu photo session may have saved a man's life.  Thomas is disturbed by a knock on the door, and it is the two girls again, with whom he has a romp in his studio and falls asleep. Awakening, he finds they hope he will photograph them, but he realizes there may be more to the photographs in the park. He tells them to leave, saying, ""Tomorrow! Tomorrow!""

 Saudi Arabia played an active role in attempting to bring the Palestinians towards a self-governing condition which would permit negotiations with Israel. It has done so primarily by trying to mend the schism between Fatah and Hamas, most notably when King Abdullah invited the two factions to negotiations in Mecca resulting in the Mecca Agreement of February 7, 2007. The agreement soon failed, but Saudi Arabia has continued to support a national unity government for the Palestinians, and strongly opposed the war in Gaza in early 2009.

 On 17 October 2023, an [[explosion]] took place in the parking lot of the courtyard of [[al-Ahli Arab Hospital]] in [[Gaza City]] during the [[2023 Israel–Hamas war]], resulting in a large number of fatalities and injuries.
 
-The hospital, along with the entire northern part of the Gaza Strip, had received evacuation orders from Israel four days earlier. At the time of the explosion, many displaced Palestinians were taking refuge at the hospital. Reports of the number of fatalities vary widely, with the total still unknown. The [[Hamas]]-run [[Gaza Health Ministry]] initially reported a figure of over 500 deaths, before revising the count to 471. The Anglican Diocese that manages the hospital believes 200 people died in the explosion, while the U.S. intelligence agencies assessed a death toll between 100 and 300.

 The cause of the explosion is contested. Israel, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada said that their intelligence sources indicate the cause of the explosion was a failed [[Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel|rocket launch]] by the [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]] (PIJ) from within Gaza, while the PIJ has denied any involvement. Hamas said that [[Israel]] carried out an [[airstrike]] on the hospital. Experts largely agreed that a misfired rocket launched from within Gaza was the likely cause of the explosion based on video analysis and the extent of the damage caused by the impact.

The US and United Kingdom did not send a representative. The Israeli UN Ambassador called the event despicable, false and anti-Semitic while the Israeli foreign minister accused the Palestinians of spreading lies and distorting history.

""The United States is deeply troubled by the Israeli government’s reported decision to advance planning for over 4,000 settlement units in the West Bank. We are similarly concerned by reports of changes to Israel’s system of settlement administration that expedite the planning and approvals of settlements"". Tor Wennesland, United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process urged a halt and reversal of the decisions and said ""I am deeply concerned by the Israeli Government’s decision yesterday to alter settlement planning procedures that have been in place since 1996, which is expected to expedite settlement expansion.

Alistair Crooke, a former Middle East adviser to the EU foreign policy chief [[Javier Solana]], similarly observed, ""Dahlan refused to deal with (the independent interior minister appointed to the unity government), and put his troops on the streets in defiance of the interior minister. Hamas felt that they had little option but to take control of security away from forces which were in fact creating insecurity."" Hence, Hamas was not attempting a coup against the government or the Fatah organization as a whole but also against Dahlan's U.S.-funded militia (and individual Fatah loyalists it blamed for the murder of Hamas members).'&lt;/ref> subsequently warring with Israel.

 On 20 October 2023, the [[Associated Press]] (AP) reported that it concluded from analyzing ""more than a dozen videos from the moments before, during and after the hospital explosion, as well as satellite imagery and photos"" that ""the rocket that broke up in the air was fired from within Palestinian territory, and that the hospital explosion was most likely caused when part of that rocket crashed to the ground"", while acknowledging the unavailability of definitive proof. AP reported that its preliminary conclusion was supported by experts in open-source intelligence, geolocation, and rocketry, ""who all agreed the most likely scenario was a rocket from within Gaza that veered off and came apart seconds before the explosion."" Andrea Richardson, an experienced war crimes investigator, told AP: ""From the video evidence that I have seen, it's very clear that the rockets came from within Gaza."" Justin Crump, an intelligence consultant, said: ""You can see obviously it fails in flight, it spins out and disintegrates, and the impacts on the ground follow that."" Henry Schlottman, another intelligence expert, indicated that the most likely scenario based on available video evidence is that a rocket was launched within Gaza, failed mid-air, and accidentally struck the hospital.&lt;ref name="":7"" />

 CNN consulted a leading American acoustic expert who spoke anonymously due to a lack of permission to speak publicly from the expert's university. The acoustic expert analyzed the sound waveform and concluded that although the changes in frequency indicated the projectile was in motion, no information could be gleaned regarding the direction of the motion. CNN also reported that the dark scorch marks on the ""dark patches on the ground fanning out in a southwesterly direction from the crater,"" and burnt trees and a knocked-over lamppost behind the crater were consistent with a rocket approaching from the southwest. CNN noted that, if the projectile were an artillery munition, this could indicate a trajectory from the northeast, but the direction on impact would be inconclusive if the projectile malfunctioned and broke apart in the air. Markus Schiller, a missile expert who has provided analyses for [[NATO]] and the European Union, told CNN that he believed a malfunctioning rocket ""fell apart mid-air"" and crashed into the car park. He also said that it was not possible for him to confirm it with the ""usual analysis drawing on altitude, flight path and the burn time"" because it is not possible to predict the flight path and behavior of a malfunctioning rocket.&lt;ref name=""CNNInvestigates"" />

 In the [[2006 Palestinian legislative election|Palestinian legislative elections]] on 25 January 2006, [[Hamas]] emerged victorious and nominated [[Ismail Haniyeh]] as the Authority's Prime Minister. However, the national unity Palestinian government effectively collapsed, when a violent conflict between Hamas and Fatah erupted, mainly in the Gaza Strip. After the [[Battle for Gaza (2007)|Gaza Strip was taken over by Hamas]] on 14 June 2007, the Authority's Chairman [[Mahmoud Abbas]] dismissed the [[Palestinian March 2007 National Unity Government|Hamas-led unity government]] and appointed [[Salam Fayyad]] as [[Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Prime Minister]], dismissing Haniyeh. The move wasn't recognized by Hamas, thus resulting in two separate administrations – the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and a rival [[Governance of the Gaza Strip|Hamas government]] in the Gaza Strip. The [[Fatah–Hamas reconciliation process|reconciliation process]] to unite the Palestinian governments achieved some progress over the years, but had failed to produce a re-unification.

 The [[UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] has estimated that Gaza fishermen need to journey at least 12–15 nautical miles from shore to catch larger shoals, and sardines in particular are {{convert|6|nmi|km|abbr=on}} offshore. Shoals closer to shore have been depleted. The total catch pre-blockade in 1999 was nearly 4,000 tons, this was reduced to 2,700 tons in 2008. In the 90s, the Gaza fishing industry was worth $10&amp;nbsp;million annually or 4% of the total Palestinian economy; this was halved between 2001 and 2006. 45,000 Palestinians were employed in the fishing industry, employed in jobs such as catching fish, repairing nets and selling fish.

The issue came to international attention in 2010, when a flotilla of activists attempted to break the blockade and carry humanitarian aid into Gaza. Nine were killed when the Israeli navy entered the flotilla. The incident shone a spotlight onto the blockade of Gaza. At one stage, prohibited materials included coriander, ginger, nutmeg and newspapers. A relaxation of the rules in June 2009 meant that processed hummus was allowed in, but not hummus with extras such as pine nuts or mushrooms. One of the biggest issues has been building materials. The strict restrictions on goods going into Gaza meant that it was impossible to start reconstruction work; it was therefore impossible to repair shattered windows to keep out the winter rain.'&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=288686 |title=Court extends remand of Israelis aboard Gaza ship |work=Jerusalem Post |access-date=4 November 2012 |archive-date=15 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015230656/http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=288686 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref>&lt;ref name=""idf100908"">{{cite web |url=http://www.mag.idf.il/163-4314-en/patzar.aspx |title=Position paper on the naval blockade on Gaza |date=2010-09-08 |publisher=idf.il |access-date=28 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116231842/http://www.mag.idf.il/163-4314-en/patzar.aspx |archive-date=2012-01-16}} ([https://web.archive.org/web/20131015054031/http://www.mag.idf.il/sip_storage//FILES/5/915.pdf Full version in Hebrew])&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>[https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/10/12/gaza-donors-un-should-press-israel-blockade ''Gaza: Donors, UN Should Press Israel on Blockade''] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104210821/https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/10/12/gaza-donors-un-should-press-israel-blockade |date=4 January 2017 }}, Human Rights Watch, 12 October 2014.&lt;/ref>

 The war was part of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]], an ongoing dispute that included many battles and wars since 1948, when the state of Israel was formed. During the Six-Day War of 1967, Israel had captured Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, roughly half of Syria's Golan Heights, and the territories of the [[West Bank]] which had been [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|held by Jordan since 1948]].&lt;ref>{{cite book|author=Shlomo Ben-Ami |title=Scars of War, Wounds of Peace: The Israeli–Arab Tragedy |year=2005 |publisher=Phoenix |isbn=978-0-7538-2104-6}}&lt;/ref>

 The [[Intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine|sectarian conflict]] between Palestinian Jews and Arabs emerged in the early 20th century, peaking into a full-scale [[1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine|civil war]] in 1947 and transforming into the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|First Arab–Israeli War]] in May 1948, following the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]]. Large-scale hostilities mostly ended with the cease-fire agreements after the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]]. Peace agreements were signed between Israel and Egypt in 1979, resulting in Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula and abolishment of the [[Israeli Military Governorate|military governance system]] in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, in favor of [[Israeli Civil Administration]] and consequent unilateral annexation of the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem.
 
-The nature of the conflict has shifted over the years from the large-scale, regional Arab–Israeli conflict to a more local [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], which peaked during the [[1982 Lebanon War]]. With the decline of the [[First Palestinian Intifada]], the interim [[Oslo Accords]] led to the creation of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] in 1994, within the context of the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process]]. The same year Israel and Jordan reached a peace accord. A cease-fire has been largely maintained between Israel and Baathist Syria, as well as with Lebanon since 2006. Despite the peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan, interim peace accords with Palestine and the generally existing cease-fire, the Arab League and Israel remain at odds with each other over many issues.

 Developments in the course of the Syrian Civil War reshuffled the situation near Israel's northern border, putting the [[Syrian Arab Republic]], [[Hezbollah]] and the [[Syrian opposition]] at odds with each other and complicating their relations with Israel. The conflict between Israel and [[Hamas]]-ruled [[Gaza City|Gaza]], which resulted in the 2014 cease-fire, is usually also considered part of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Its 2006–2012 phase is, however, also attributed to the [[Iran–Israel proxy conflict]] in the region ([[Syria]] and [[Hezbollah]] are being supported by Iran). Since 2012, Iran (predominantly [[Shia Islam|Shia]]) has cut ties with the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Hamas]] movement on account of the latter's support for the [[Syrian opposition|opposition]] in the [[Syrian Civil War]].

NBC News stated that the claim was likely erroneous, and based on the conflation of two separate statements made by IDF soldiers.&lt;ref name=""NBCnews"" />

-The Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel {{ill|ARCCI|he|איגוד מרכזי הסיוע לנפגעות ונפגעי תקיפה מינית בישראל}} recently published the first comprehensive survey of the multiple accounts of sexual violence carried out during the attack. The 35 pages report suggests that the attacks were more widespread than initially believed, occurring at various locations across southern Israel.
