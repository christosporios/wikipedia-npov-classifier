 However, Reyes was ordered disqualified by the First Division of the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] (Comelec) over her citizenship status.  In its ruling, the Comelec cited the Citizenship Retention and Re-acquisition Act of 2003, claiming that Reyes was still an American citizen and she had failed to renounce her citizenship.  In addition, the ruling notes that Reyes did not submit sufficient evidence that she had been resident in Marinduque for at least one year, citing documents which point to her term as Provincial Administrator.&lt;ref name=""reyes2"">{{cite news | title=US citizenship mars candidate's bid in Marinduque | url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/04/03/13/us-citizenship-mars-candidates-bid-marinduque | publisher=[[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs]] | date=April 3, 2013 | accessdate=April 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref>  The ruling was affirmed by the Comelec ''en banc'' on May 14, 2013.&lt;ref name=""enbanc"">{{cite news | author=Cinco, Maricar | title=Comelec rules with finality: LP Marinduque bet disqualified | url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/411133/comelec-rules-with-finality-lp-marinduque-bet-disqualified | work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] | publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer, Inc. | date=May 17, 2013 | accessdate=May 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref> But Commission on Election Chairman Sixto Brillantes in his dissenting opinion pointed that the evidence presented by Velasco's camp is a double hearsay and inadmissible since it was never sworn nor authenticated by the issuing officer and it was taken in an internet blog of unknown blogger.
 
-Despite this, Reyes continued to sit as representative of Marinduque, with the Reyes camp claiming that it is the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET), and not the Comelec or the Supreme Court, that should have jurisdiction over the case. On September 11, 2014, Gabriela Representative Luzviminda Ilagan said that the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal voting 4-3 finally decided that they (HRET members) will uphold the exclusivity of jurisdiction over any protest or contest in the result of election of any House of Representatives members. With this development, the Commission's and the Supreme Court's respective decisions will be no longer in effect. Thus, Representative Regina Ongsiako Reyes was the seating Congresswoman of the Lone District of Marinduque but did not finish her 3-year term as she was later removed from her post and replaced by Velasco in February 2016.
