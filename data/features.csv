 In 2022, Human Rights Watch issued a report on the situation in the Gaza Strip, which it called an ""open-air prison"" due to the [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockade]] and held Israel responsible as the occupying power, and to a lesser degree Egypt, which has restricted movement of Palestinians through its border.&lt;ref name=""HRW111""/> The report highlighted how this blockade has led to humanitarian crises, namely shortages of essential supplies, limited access to healthcare, and high levels of poverty and unemployment among the Palestinian population in Gaza.&lt;ref name=""HRW111""/> It claimed that Israel has formed a formal policy of separation between Gaza and the West Bank, despite both forming parts of the [[Palestinian territories]].&lt;ref name=""HRW111""/> The Israeli blockade on Gaza has restricted the freedom of movement of Gaza Palestinians to both the West Bank and the outside world; in particular, Palestinian professionals were most impacted by these restrictions, as applying for travel permit takes several weeks.&lt;ref name=""HRW111""/>

 Hamas was founded by Palestinian [[imam]] and activist [[Ahmed Yassin]] in 1987, after the outbreak of the [[First Intifada]] against the [[Israeli occupied territories|Israeli occupation]].

 Jordan occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, from 1948 to 1967, annexing it in 1950 and granting Jordanian citizenship to the residents in 1954 (the annexation claims and citizenship grants were rescinded in 1988 when Jordan acknowledged the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) as the sole representative of the Palestinian people).

The settlers claimed that many of the reported ""price tag"" operations by settlers were actually carried out by Palestinians with the aim of tarnishing the settlers' image.&lt;ref>{{cite news |author= Yair Altman | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3976976,00.html |title=Settlers: Arabs, leftists staged 'price tag' act Palestinians, leftwing activists documented while sawing trees in bid to accuse settlers |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref>

 During the cease-fire, Henry Kissinger mediated a series of exchanges with the Egyptians, Israelis and the Soviets. On October 24, Sadat publicly appealed for American and Soviet contingents to oversee the ceasefire; it was quickly rejected in a White House statement. Kissinger also met with Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin to discuss convening a peace conference with Geneva as the venue. Later in the evening (9:35&amp;nbsp;pm) of October 24–25, Brezhnev sent Nixon a ""very urgent"" letter.&lt;ref name=""William B Quandt p 121"">William B Quandt, ''Peace Process'', p. 121.&lt;/ref>&lt;ref name=""Rabinovich, p. 479"">Rabinovich, p. 479.&lt;/ref>

 Shortly after independence, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that the fundamental principles of international law, accepted as binding by all civilized nations, were to be incorporated in the domestic legal system of Israel.{{sfn|Kretzmer|2009|p=278}}{{sfn|Kretzmer|2012|pp=31ff}}  In the aftermath of the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Israel [[military occupation|occupied]] the [[Sinai Peninsula]], the [[Gaza Strip]], [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|West Bank]] and [[Golan Heights]]. [[Theodor Meron]] at the time the Israeli government's authority on the topic of international law and legal counsel to the [[Israeli Foreign Ministry]], was asked to provide a memorandum regarding the status in international law of proposed settlement of the territories, which he subsequently addressed to the Foreign Minister [[Abba Eban]] on 14 September 1967. He concluded that short-term military settlements would be permissible.{{sfn|Macintyre|2006}} but that ""civilian settlement in the [[administered territories]] contravenes the explicit provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention,"" adding that the prohibition on any such [[population transfer]] was categorical, and that ""civilian settlement in the administered territories contravenes the explicit provisions of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]].""{{sfn|Gorenberg|2007|pp=99–100}} It follows from the presence on files of these notes, [[Gershom Gorenberg]] argues, that the Prime Minister at the time, [[Levi Eshkol]], knew that Israeli settlements in the territories Israel had just occupied would violate international laws and that by that time Eshkol had been actively engaged in exploring the possibility of settling the newly conquered region.{{sfn|Gorenberg|2007|p=100}}  Meron’s  unequivocal legal opinion was marked  top secret and  not made public.{{sfn|Segev |2016|p=576}}

 In 1978 and 1979 the Israeli Supreme court, prompted by the new government policies, ruled on two important cases that set out the requirements for Israeli settlement legality under international law. In Ayauub ''et al.'' vs. Minister of Defence (the Beit-El Toubas case), the Court determined that the Hague Conventions but not the Geneva Conventions could be applied by Israeli courts on land and settlement issues in the occupied territories. The following year the Court ruled on Dwikat ''et al.'' vs. the Government of Israel (the [[Elon Moreh]] case), outlining the Hague Conventions' limitations on Israeli land acquisition and settlements. Settlements, whether on private or public land, could not be considered permanent, nor could the land be permanently confiscated, only temporarily requisitioned. Settlements on private land were legal only if determined to be a military necessity; the original owner retained title to the land and must be paid rental fees for its use. Public lands' ""possession cannot be alienated, nor its basic character transformed"".&lt;ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4326305 ""Israel and the West Bank after Elon Moreh: The Politics of De Facto Annexation""] Ian Lustick&lt;/ref>

 In two cases decided shortly after independence (the Shimshon and Stampfer cases) the Israeli Supreme Court held that the fundamental rules of international law accepted as binding by all ""civilized"" nations were incorporated in the domestic legal system of Israel. The Nuremberg Military Tribunal had already determined that the articles annexed to the [[Hague IV Convention]] of 1907 were customary law, recognized by all civilized nations.{{sfn|Kretzmer|2009|p=278}}{{sfn|Kretzmer|2012|p=51}}

 In subsequent cases, such as the Ja'amait Ascan case regarding a project to link West Bank towns to Jerusalem with a four-way highway network, the Court  ruled that Article 43 of the Hague IV Convention is a mandatory planning consideration for approval of building projects in the West Bank. The convention established that an occupier may not take into consideration ""the national, economic or social interests of his own country, unless they have implications for his security interests or the interests of the local population."" [[Aharon Barak|Justice Aharon Barak]] ruled against the Palestinian plaintiff, and for the project, accepting the claim by respondents that while it would benefit the residents of Israel, it would also favour the interests of West Bank Arabs commuting to Israel.{{sfn|Kretzmer|2012|pp=69-69}}

 The '''Israeli-occupied territories''' are the territories [[Military occupation|occupied]] by [[Israel]] during the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967. Originally, those territories included the Syrian [[Golan Heights]], the Egyptian [[Sinai Peninsula]] and [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|Egyptian-occupied Gaza Strip]] and [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordanian-annexed West Bank]]. The first use of the term 'territories occupied' was in [[United Nations Security Council]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|Resolution 242]] following the Six-Day War in 1967, which called for ""the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East"" to be achieved by ""the application of both the following principles: ... Withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict ... Termination of all claims or states of belligerency"" and respect for the right of every state in the area to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.  In addition to the territories occupied following the Six-Day War, Israel also occupied portions of [[Southern Lebanon]] following the [[1982 Lebanon War]], and maintained a military and administrative presence there until withdrawing in 2000.

Despite dissolving the military government, in line with Egyptian demands, the term ''Israeli-occupied territories'' remains in use, referring to the [[West Bank]] including [[East Jerusalem]], the [[Gaza Strip]] and Western [[Golan Heights]]. Between 1998 and 2012, the term [[Palestinian territories, Occupied]] was used to refer to territories controlled by the [[Palestinian Authority]] in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

-To support the Bar Lev Line, Israel built an well planned and elaborate system of roads. Three main roads ran north-south.

The second was the Artillery Road, around {{convert|10|-|12|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} from the canal.

 The defense of the Sinai depended upon two plans, [[Dovecote]] (שׁוֹבָךְ יוֹנִים/Shovakh Yonim) and Rock (סֶלַע/Sela). In both plans, the Israeli General Staff expected the Bar-Lev Line to serve as a ""stop line"" or ''kav atzira''—a defensive line that had to be held at all cost. As noted by an Israeli colonel shortly after the War of Attrition, ""The line was created to provide military answers to two basic needs: first, to prevent the possibility of a major Egyptian assault on Sinai with the consequent creation of a bridgehead which could lead to all-out war; and, second, to reduce as much as possible the casualties among the defending troops.""&lt;ref name=""gawrych16-18"" />

 In February 2005, the Israeli government voted to implement a [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|unilateral disengagement plan]] from the Gaza Strip.  The plan began to be implemented on 15 August 2005, and was completed on 12 September 2005. Under the plan, all Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip (and four in the West Bank) and the joint Israeli-Palestinian Erez Industrial Zone were dismantled with the removal of all 9,000 Israeli settlers (most of them in the [[Gush Katif]] settlement area in the Strip's southwest) and military bases. Some settlers resisted the order, and were forcibly removed by the IDF.  On 12 September 2005 the Israeli cabinet formally declared an end to Israeli military occupation of the Gaza Strip.  To avoid allegations that it was still in occupation of any part of the Gaza Strip, Israel also withdrew from the [[Philadelphi Route]], which is a narrow strip adjacent to the [[Egypt–Gaza border|Strip's border with Egypt]], after Egypt's agreement to secure its side of the border.  Under the Oslo Accords the Philadelphi Route was to remain under Israeli control to prevent the smuggling of materials (such as ammunition) and people across the border with Egypt.  With Egypt agreeing to patrol its side of the border, it was hoped that the objective would be achieved.  However, Israel maintained its control over the crossings in and out of Gaza.  The Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza was monitored by the Israeli army through special surveillance cameras.  Official documents such as passports, I.D. cards, export and import papers, and many others had to be approved by the Israeli army.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

 In the [[2006 Palestinian legislative election|Palestinian legislative elections]] on 25 January 2006, [[Hamas]] emerged victorious and nominated [[Ismail Haniyeh]] as the Authority's Prime Minister. However, the national unity Palestinian government effectively collapsed, when a violent conflict between Hamas and Fatah erupted, mainly in the Gaza Strip. After the [[Battle for Gaza (2007)|Gaza Strip was taken over by Hamas]] on 14 June 2007, the Authority's Chairman [[Mahmoud Abbas]] dismissed the [[Palestinian March 2007 National Unity Government|Hamas-led unity government]] and appointed [[Salam Fayyad]] as [[Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Prime Minister]], dismissing Haniyeh. The move wasn't recognized by Hamas, thus resulting in two separate administrations – the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and a rival [[Governance of the Gaza Strip|Hamas government]] in the Gaza Strip. The [[Fatah–Hamas reconciliation process|reconciliation process]] to unite the Palestinian governments achieved some progress over the years, but had failed to produce a re-unification.

'Dahlan, who was supported by U.S. officials, has been a bitter enemy of Hamas since his 1996 crackdown on the movement.

Alistair Crooke, a former Middle East adviser to the EU foreign policy chief [[Javier Solana]], similarly observed, ""Dahlan refused to deal with (the independent interior minister appointed to the unity government), and put his troops on the streets in defiance of the interior minister. Hamas felt that they had little option but to take control of security away from forces which were in fact creating insecurity."" Hence, Hamas was not attempting a coup against the government or the Fatah organization as a whole but also against Dahlan's U.S.-funded militia (and individual Fatah loyalists it blamed for the murder of Hamas members).'&lt;/ref> subsequently warring with Israel.

 The Palestinian Authority was formed in 1994, pursuant to the Oslo Accords between the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) and the government of [[Israel]], as a five-year [[Provisional government|interim body]]. Further negotiations were then meant to take place between the two parties regarding its final status.  According to the Oslo Accords, the Palestinian Authority was designated to have exclusive control over both security-related and civilian issues in Palestinian urban areas (referred to as ""[[West Bank Areas in the Oslo II Accord#Area A|Area A]]"") and only civilian control over Palestinian rural areas (""[[West Bank Areas in the Oslo II Accord#Area B|Area B]]""). The remainder of the territories, including [[Israeli settlements]], the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] region and bypass roads between [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] communities, were to remain under Israeli control (""[[Area C (West Bank)|Area C]]""). [[East Jerusalem]] was excluded from the Accords. Negotiations with several Israeli governments had resulted in the Authority gaining further control of some areas, but control was then lost in some areas when the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) retook several strategic positions during the [[Second Intifada|Second (""Al-Aqsa"") Intifada]]. In 2005, after the Second Intifada, Israel [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|withdrew unilaterally from its settlements in the Gaza Strip]], thereby expanding Palestinian Authority control to the entire strip&lt;ref>P R.

 In the [[2006 Palestinian legislative election|Palestinian legislative elections]] on 25 January 2006, [[Hamas]] emerged victorious and nominated [[Ismail Haniyeh]] as the Authority's Prime Minister. However, the national unity Palestinian government effectively collapsed, when a violent conflict between Hamas and Fatah erupted, mainly in the Gaza Strip. After the [[Battle for Gaza (2007)|Gaza Strip was taken over by Hamas]] on 14 June 2007, the Authority's Chairman [[Mahmoud Abbas]] dismissed the [[Palestinian March 2007 National Unity Government|Hamas-led unity government]] and appointed [[Salam Fayyad]] as [[Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Prime Minister]], dismissing Haniyeh.

The [[Fatah–Hamas reconciliation process|reconciliation process]] to unite the Palestinian governments achieved some progress over the years, but had failed to produce a re-unification.

 # Between 2002 and 2004, the PA paid 22M NIS to cover other expenses&amp;nbsp;– lawyers' fees, fines, and allocations for released prisoners. This includes lawyers' fees paid directly by the PA and fees paid through the Prisoners Club.

 In March 2009, an extra 800 shekels ($190) was added to the stipends given to Palestinians affiliated with PLO factions in Israeli prisons, as confirmed by the head of Palestinian Prisoner Society in Nablus Ra'ed Amer. Each PLO-affiliated prisoner receives 1,000 shekels ($238) per month, an extra 300 shekels ($71) if they are married, and an extra 50 shekels ($12) for each child.&lt;ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=208966 |title=Extra 800 shekels added to PLO prisoner payments following Abbas' order &amp;#124; Maan News Agency |agency=Ma'an News Agency |accessdate=26 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528000532/http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=208966 |archive-date=28 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref>
